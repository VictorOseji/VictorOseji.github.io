As a seasoned data scientist, my journey began with a foundation in Pure and Applied Chemistry, sparking my passion for understanding intricate systems. With over six years of experience in the analytics field, I've cultivated a diverse background that enables me to bridge the gap between technical insights and strategic business decisions.

My career has flourished across industries, from e-commerce where I excelled as a BI Analyst, to thriving in the consumer goods and pharmaceutical sectors as a Business Data Analyst. This breadth of experience has broadened my perspective and deepened my belief in the transformative power of data.

Proficient in R and adept with Python, SQL, Power BI, and JavaScript, I possess a versatile toolkit to uncover meaningful insights and create impactful solutions. My grasp of machine learning concepts equips me to harness data's full potential, fostering innovation and growth.

What truly ignites my passion is my curiosity for knowledge and collaboration. I thrive in diverse teams, crafting exceptional solutions that tackle complex challenges and unlock new opportunities. I firmly believe that data is the key to unearthing possibilities for individuals and businesses. This belief drives me to push boundaries and create outstanding outcomes.
